# CMPM163HW3

This was created to satisfy the requirements of CMPM163 HW3. The program uses shader graph and two noise functions in order to create a fire shader. It was made with some assistance from a youtube tutorial, that demonstrated noise functions and how they worked, and how to use them to create desired outcomes in unity. 

A box is depicted, amongst a nicer skybox than the default Unity one, that is one fire using a Quad that has the shader that I created on it. It uses time in order to modify the UV of the noise function, then it applies a color to the outcome of the two noise functions. 

PART B
-----------------
For part B, there are a lot of ideas that I am really interested in exploring. Creating fire for this project was very interesting, and could lead to some very nice explosion material, but I think I would really like to explore something else, like smoke simulation or volumtric lighting. The presentation on Thursday in class was very interesting and made me want to explore more of these types of things. Stained glass is another area of interest to me, specifically creating rays of light that shine through them. 

If I had to choose right now, I would go with fire and explosions, as I already have a solid grasp on how they work. Using Unity ShaderGraph, you can use noise functions very easilly in order to create really good looking shaders. I would like to expand upon my fire, maybe creating a particle system that would emulate a quick, fast buring fire when shot with a gun or something a long those lines. This could be used for muzzle flashes, or potentially red barrel type explosions. 

As for my group members, I have not decided yet, but will be reaching out on slack in order to assemble more members soon
