# CMPM163HW3

This was created to satisfy the requirements of CMPM163 HW3. The program uses shader graph and two noise functions in order to create a fire shader. It was made with some assistance from a youtube tutorial, that demonstrated noise functions and how they worked, and how to use them to create desired outcomes in unity. 

A box is depicted, amongst a nicer skybox than the default Unity one, that is one fire using a Quad that has the shader that I created on it. It uses time in order to modify the UV of the noise function, then it applies a color to the outcome of the two noise functions.
